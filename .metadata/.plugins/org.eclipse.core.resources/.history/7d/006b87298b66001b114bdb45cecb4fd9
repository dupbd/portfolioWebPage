<p class="aboutme" style="margin:20px;">hello, this is my about me. I am from NC and went to HS in PA, then I 
went off to college in AZ where i studied Criminal Justice. AFter that I moved to DC and lived with an old high school friend. 
I worked in Insurance whole I was there. I moved to Asheville around April of 2016 and have loved it ever since. As soon as 
I got here I began working in restaurants before finding my current job at another Insurance agency simmilar to what I was 
doing in DC. <br><br>I startet teaching myself how to code in 2016 when in DC. I started learning Python and worked
through a few online courses. I never thought much would come from it but when in AVL I decided to get serious about it. 
I enrolled in a Bootcap called Tech Talent South and went through their Java Code Immersion Program. I excelled in 
that class and was offered a TA position almost immediatly after completion. I continue to TA different class for them now.</p>
