<p class="aboutme" style="margin:20px;">Hey! My name is Ben Dupont, I am a software developer located in Asheville, NC.
The main language and tools I work with are Java and the Spring Framework to make web pages and applications. 
I am also comfortable using HTML5, CSS3, and JS. I have a working knowledge of Python, C++, and SQL. 
<br><br>I am originally from Winston-Salem, NC but moved to Pennsylvania for High School and Arizona for College. In AZ I went to 
Arizona State and majored in Criminal Justice. After school I moved to the DC area for a year before heading back to NC where I fell in
love with Asheville. 
<br><br>I began my programming journey in 2017 when living in DC teaching myself Python through online courses. When I moved to 
Asheville I decided to start taking things more seriously as I wanted to persue this as a career option. I enrolled in a 
Code Immersion Program through the school Tech Talent South. During that program we mainly focued on Java, as well as the fundamentals
of HTML, CSS, and JS. I performed well during the class and was immediatly offered a TA position after I graduated. 
I have been a TA for multiple classes since.
<br><br>In my free time I enjoy playing guitar in two bands here in Asheville, as well as enjoying time with my two dogs, Luna, and Jerry.
<br><br>I am looking forward to everything that this career path has to show me and looking forward to getting to know whoever
may be reading this soon! Head on over to the Contact Me page at the top and reach out!</p>
